/**
 * The `dns` module enables name resolution. For example, use it to look up IP
 * addresses of host names.
 *
 * Although named for the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), it does not always use the
 * DNS protocol for lookups. {@link lookup} uses the operating system
 * facilities to perform name resolution. It may not need to perform any network
 * communication. To perform name resolution the way other applications on the same
 * system do, use {@link lookup}.
 *
 * ```js
 * const dns = require('dns');
 *
 * dns.lookup('example.org', (err, address, family) => {
 *   console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family);
 * });
 * // address: "93.184.216.34" family: IPv4
 * ```
 *
 * All other functions in the `dns` module connect to an actual DNS server to
 * perform name resolution. They will always use the network to perform DNS
 * queries. These functions do not use the same set of configuration files used by {@link lookup} (e.g. `/etc/hosts`). Use these functions to always perform
 * DNS queries, bypassing other name-resolution facilities.
 *
 * ```js
 * const dns = require('dns');
 *
 * dns.resolve4('archive.org', (err, addresses) => {
 *   if (err) throw err;
 *
 *   console.log(`addresses: ${JSON.stringify(addresses)}`);
 *
 *   addresses.forEach((a) => {
 *     dns.reverse(a, (err, hostnames) => {
 *       if (err) {
 *         throw err;
 *       }
 *       console.log(`reverse for ${a}: ${JSON.stringify(hostnames)}`);
 *     });
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See the `Implementation considerations section` for more information.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/dns.js)

    /**
     * Resolves a host name (e.g. `'nodejs.org'`) into the first found A (IPv4) or
     * AAAA (IPv6) record. All `option` properties are optional. If `options` is an
     * integer, then it must be `4` or `6` â€“ if `options` is not provided, then IPv4
     * and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.
     *
     * With the `all` option set to `true`, the arguments for `callback` change to`(err, addresses)`, with `addresses` being an array of objects with the
     * properties `address` and `family`.
     *
     * On error, `err` is an `Error` object, where `err.code` is the error code.
     * Keep in mind that `err.code` will be set to `'ENOTFOUND'` not only when
     * the host name does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways
     * such as no available file descriptors.
     *
     * `dns.lookup()` does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol.
     * The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names
     * with addresses, and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but
     * important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some
     * time to consult the `Implementation considerations section` before using`dns.lookup()`.
     *
     * Example usage:
     *
     * ```js
     * const dns = require('dns');
     * const options = {
     *   family: 6,
     *   hints: dns.ADDRCONFIG | dns.V4MAPPED,
     * };
     * dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, address, family) =>
     *   console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family));
     * // address: "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946" family: IPv6
     *
     * // When options.all is true, the result will be an Array.
     * options.all = true;
     * dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, addresses) =>
     *   console.log('addresses: %j', addresses));
     * // addresses: [{"address":"2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946","family":6}]
     * ```
     *
     * If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, and `all`is not set to `true`, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `address` and`family` properties.
     * @since v0.1.90
